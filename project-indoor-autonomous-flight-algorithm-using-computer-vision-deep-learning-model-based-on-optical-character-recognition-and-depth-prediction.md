# Indoor Autonomous Flight Algorithm using Computer Vision Deep Learning Model based on Optical Character Recognition and Depth Prediction

The purpose of this project is to design a drone system that can avoid obstacles using a depth
prediction model, and fly to a desired indoor location using an optical character recognition
model, based on computer vision deep learning.
