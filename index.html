        <p align="justify">
          I am interested in how to build AGI and implement it in real-world to help people. Therefore, my interests span a wide range of areas; Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Cognitive Science and Bioinformactics. Plus, Multimodal/Few-shot/Transfer Learning.

          I was previously interested in optical character recognition, single-camera depth prediction, object recognition and detection, and smoke removal among computer vision. Additionally, I was also interested in autonomous driving and flying with computer vision. Therefore, I have done projects and research on these topics. In addition, I have proposed and carried out various projects to solve social problems.
